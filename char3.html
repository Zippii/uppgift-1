			<h1>Crystina the Knight</h1>

			<h1>Description</h1>
			<p>Crystina is a female knight sent by the northern kingdom to compete in the arena battles. She wears a white/black armour that covers her entirely but she wears no helmet. She’s got brown hair bangs that are not very long. She wields a sword and a shield. Crystina is melee based fighter. 
	Crystina is a hybrid fighter that can rely on both physical damage and magic power. Her abilities can scale with both magic power and physical power.</p>

			<ul>
				<strong>Abilities</strong>
				<li> <strong>(Q) Three talon strike:</strong> Crystina swings her sword three times in target direction, enemies hit gets their armour lowered and gets damaged a percentage of her magic power and physical power.</li>
				<li> <strong>(W) Shield block:</strong> Crystina raises her shield to block incoming damage, taking reduced damage from spells that hits her and completely blocking the first spell that hits her.</li>
				<li> <strong>(E) Vault:</strong> Crystina jumps against an enemy kicking them and vaulting away, after the vault a mark appears that Crystina can proc for extra damage on her next auto-attack. </li>
				<li> <strong>(R) Blade dance:</strong> Crystina blinks to an enemy and teleports around them while slashing with her blades, while blade dancing she’s untargetable and can’t get attacked. If there’s several enemies nearby she attacks them too but for reduced damage. 
	<br><strong>[Note that the R is random for additional enemies meaning that she hits them randomly and usually doesn’t hit all of the enemies nearby.]</strong></li>
			</ul>
