			<h1>Barbarian Lord</h1>

			<h1>Description</h1>
			<p>Barbarian Lord is the leader of the barbarians of Crystalia, he’s dressed in a ragged brown shirt and ragged trousers. He’s bigger than a ordinary guy and a lot stronger. His weapon is a big sledgehammer and he’s very brutal. 
	Barbarian Lord is a melee based fight that scales well with physical power, even HP is decent for him.</p>

			<ul>
				<strong>Abilities</strong>
				<li> <strong>(Q) Tremor:</strong> Barbarian Lord smashes with his hammer in the ground causing a tremor in a straight line in front of him, enemies hit takes damage and are slowed.</li>
				<li> <strong>(W) Warcry:</strong> Barbarian Lord shouts increasing armour, magic resist, damage for himself and allies nearby gets a percentage of the effects as well.</li>
				<li> <strong>(E) Sundering Blows:</strong> Barbarian Lord demolishes the armour of enemies, every third hit he deals extra damage and lowers their armour by a percentage (stacking 3 times).</li>
				<li> <strong>(R) Iron Fist:</strong> Barbarian Lords quickly grows in size and gets a big boost across all stats for a short while, he also summons barbarians around him that attacks the closest targets until they’re either killed or their time runs out(30 seconds).
	<br><strong>[Note W and R is stackable meaning that he can get a huge stat bonus]<strong></li>
