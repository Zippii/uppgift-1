			<h1>Drunkie the Drunken</h1>

			<h1>Description</h1>
			<p>Drunkie is a rather fat male character that enjoys drinking, he’s clad in a white tunic. He’s fat and has a big beer belly as a side effect from all of his drinking. He’s also got blonde hair and a crown on his head. His weapon is a beer bottle  and his hands.
Drunkie is a melee based tank that really works well with HP increasing items though his abilities require magic power.</p>

			<ul>
				<li style="overflow:hidden;"><b>Abilities</b></li>
				<li> <strong>(Q) Barrel toss:</strong> Drunkie hurls his beer bottle at target location, if he hits an enemy they’re slowed and slightly intoxicated resulting in sloppier movement control.</li>
				<li> <strong>(W) Drink up:</strong> Drunkie drinks from his bottle and after channeling for 3 seconds he regains some HP and gets a damage reduction boost over 10 seconds.</li>
				<li> <strong>(E) Intoxication breath:</strong> Drunkie burps at target location for 2,5 seconds, enemies hit are slowed and if they get for the full duration they’re stunned and intoxicated resulting in sloppier movements.</li>
				<li> <strong>(R) Intoxicate:</strong> Drunkie throws his barrel at target location, enemies hit are slowed and really intoxicated resulting in random movement and unable to attack for 2 seconds.
				<br><strong>[Note that his R is not the same as the Q (Different animations).]</strong></li>
			</ul>
