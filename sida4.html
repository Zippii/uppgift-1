			<h1> Mechanics </h1>
			<p>
				Mechanics: The main mechanic is that you level up in the game and can purchase items that act as stat-boosters (statistics-boosters, higher damage, HP, etc.) In order to accumulate the gold and experience for said items and levels you need to go down one of the lanes and slay the enemy minions. When they’re killed they yield gold and experience to nearby players. Note: only the player actually killing the minions get the gold for them and therefore “last hitting” is important, which means to strike the finishing blow. In the forest areas, the neutral monsters also yield gold when killed. When turrets are destroyed they yield gold for the entire team. In each base at the spawning platform there’s a shop in which you can buy items for the gold you’ve accumulated. </p>
			<p>
				There’s a lot of different statistics in the game. There’s the basics such as HP(health points) and MP(Mana Points) but there’s also physical damage, magic power, attack speed, armour/magic resist increase, armour/magic penetration, etc. All the different items boost different things about these stats. The playable characters are also built after a specific stat, example: One character might have good abilities that need a lot of magic power to do damage whilst another might need physical damage for its abilities. There’s also something that all characters have which is the Auto-attack which scales with physical damage and attack speed.  (Note: There’s also ranged AAs and Melee based AAs.) </p>
			<p>	The neutral monsters in the jungle can grant buffs that you can have during a set amount of time, there’s a Mana regeneration buff and an attack speed increase buff. There’s also other monsters on the map that grant gold to the team killing it. </p>
			<p> For the character’s abilities there’s differences between the different targeting. Targeted abilities are ones that you can just activate and then click directly on your enemies. While skillshots also referred to as target location, are abilities that you need to aim yourself to hit opponents with, some can be tricky and some can be easy to land. </p>
			<p> In the client outside the game you can select the different game modes, view your profile (statistics, rankings and owned playable characters.) and finally there’s the shop in which you can buy all the different playable characters. The currency used is either real money or an in game currency that you gain after matches, the amount earned is based on time spent in the match and if it was a win or loss. </p>
